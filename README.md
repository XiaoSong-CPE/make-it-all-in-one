# File Stitcher

> Bringing files together—because they belong together! 🧩

**File Stitcher** is a powerful yet simple file merger. It seamlessly combines videos with subtitles and poster images, music with album art and lyrics, and more. These days, files are often split up for online services, making them inconvenient to use, collect, or share. This app helps bring those scattered pieces back together—because who enjoys dealing with digital clutter? 🤷‍♂️

## ❓ FAQ

### Why does my conversion keep failing? 😭

File Stitcher follows a strict "keep everything exactly the same" approach. If your files contain non-standard elements, the app won’t attempt to modify them—it will simply fail rather than alter your files unexpectedly. We plan to add a "Force Conversion" option in settings in the future.

### Does it support advanced features like batch editing and automation?

File Stitcher is designed for simplicity and elegance, not professional-grade bulk processing. If you need a clean, intuitive tool for handling a few files at a time, this is for you. But if you require advanced automation, you might want to explore other options.

Happy merging! 🎬🎵
